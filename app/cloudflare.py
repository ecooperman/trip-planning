"""Letting an email through Cloudflare Access's login gate.

Everyone reaches the app through Cloudflare Access, and the shared-apps Access
policy allows an "Invitees" group of email addresses. Approving an invite adds
the person's email to that group over Cloudflare's API, so they can sign in
(with a one-time PIN sent to that address) without anyone touching the
dashboard.

Updating a group replaces its whole rule list, so we read it, add the email and
send everything back, then check the reply really contains the email. Without
the settings (see config.py) this does nothing locally and refuses in
production, so an approval is never recorded for a person who still can't get
in.
